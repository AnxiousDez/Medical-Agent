Using data from a nationwide study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (December 2020 to March 2021), we evaluated self-reported HRQoL among HCWs and its variation by sociodemographic characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par14">HRQoL was measured using the five-dimension-five-level EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, covering five health dimensions. We explored differences in reported HRQoL by age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile, ethnicity, migration status and occupational group. Each HRQoL dimension was collapsed into a binary outcome (any problems versus none) and associations analysed using logistic regression. We also examined EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (VAS) scores using linear regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par15">Among 12,026 HCWs, 75.9% were female, 26.7% overseas-born and 29.9% from non-White ethnic groups. HCWs reported high levels of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression (43.7% and 46.1% reporting at least slight problems, respectively). Women were more likely than men to report problems across all EQ-5D-5L dimensions. Reporting health problems increased with increased deprivation. Asian overseas-born and Black HCWs were less likely than White UK-born HCWs to report anxiety/depression. Compared to the Medical group, other HCW types reported more problems with pain/discomfort (32.2% Medical, 55.4% Nursing, 45.4% Allied Health Professionals, 49.8% Ambulance groups) and anxiety/depression (36.8% Medical, 52.9% Nursing, 50.5% Ambulance groups). Nurses and ambulance workers showed particularly high rates of pain/discomfort. Overall, all HCWs reported more problems with anxiety/depression, usual activities and pain/discomfort than the Medical group. Similar associations were demonstrated in a parallel analysis of VAS scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par16">In the largest study of HRQoL in HCWs to date, EQ-5D-5L VAS scores were lower than those reported elsewhere for the general UK population (for ages up 45 years), with high levels of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort and substantial heterogeneities across EQ-5D-5L dimensions by sex, occupation and deprivation level. However, HCWs&#x02019; circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced their reporting of HRQoL. Our findings highlight the need for further research to understand the causes of lower HRQoL, particularly among women and certain occupational groups, and to inform targeted interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-025-04208-6.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>EQ-5D</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Healthcare workers</kwd><kwd>Occupation</kwd><kwd>Deprivation</kwd><kwd>United Kingdom</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health and Care Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHR302494</award-id><award-id>NIHR302338</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/V027549/1</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par33">Nearly two million people in the UK are employed in the healthcare workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The health of healthcare workers (HCWs) is critical not only for the wellbeing of such a large proportion of the population, but also for their ability to render good quality services to their patients and for future service planning. Low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may compromise quality of patient care through increased staff presenteeism, absenteeism and attrition, leading to understaffing, additional workload for other staff and longer waiting lists, with the attendant impact on the UK economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At an organisational level, HCW sickness absence is associated with a financial cost through paid sick leave and covering rota gaps with locum staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the UK, this problem is compounded by the current NHS staffing crisis, with estimated shortages of 12,000 hospital doctors and over 50,000 nurses and midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].
</p><p id="Par34">As a result, the UK DHSC has included improving health outcomes through a well-supported workforce as a priority outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and there is a new emphasis on improving staff wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, little has been reported about the HRQoL of HCWs in the UK, with the majority of recent research focussing on stress, burnout and attrition rather than the full spectrum of physical and mental health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We therefore analysed baseline data from the United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) cohort study, which is among the largest UK HCW cohort studies, to evaluate the HRQoL of the UK healthcare workforce. We aimed to identify any patterns in reporting lower HRQoL across the five identified dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L instrument, a questionnaire which measures HRQoL according to whether the respondent has problems with any of the following aspects: anxiety/depression; carrying out usual activities (e.g. work, study, housework, family or leisure activities); pain/discomfort; mobility and self-care. We also explored the association between reported HRQoL and sociodemographic factors including sex, age, occupation, ethnicity and migration status. Our analysis involved no hypothesis testing because our study aim was to explore a range of sociodemographic factors which may potentially be associated with HCWs&#x02019; perceptions of their own health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par35">UK-REACH is a programme of work established to investigate the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs from ethnic minority groups. For the present secondary data analysis, we used data collected in the baseline questionnaire of the UK-REACH prospective nationwide cohort study. The questionnaire was electronically administered between December 2020 and March 2021. For a full description of the study methods and the cohort, see the study cohort paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. No personally identifiable information was collected in the questionnaire.

The seven regulators issued emails and newsletters to their registrants containing a link to the study website. Recipients had to read the email, navigate to the study website and register to create a study profile. Following creation of their profile, potential participants were asked to read a participant information sheet and, if willing, to consent to participate in the study<italic>.</italic> The sample was supplemented with direct recruitment from participating NHS trusts. Further information regarding the recruitment process is detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Participant response rates at each stage of the recruitment process were recorded as recommended by the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par38">The EuroQoL five-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a versatile HRQoL instrument comprising a short descriptive system questionnaire covering five health dimensions (anxiety/depression; usual activities (e.g. work, study, housework, family or leisure activities); pain/discomfort; mobility and self-care) and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The questionnaire provides a simple descriptive profile of a respondent&#x02019;s health state and aids decision-making within healthcare with its varied applications, including allowing for the calculation of quality adjusted life years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is one of the most popular instruments for assessing HRQoL, having been validated in many languages and health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">We used the five-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]), which has been validated for a wide range of disease states. The respondent selects one of five levels of severity for each of the five health dimensions (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to/extreme problems). We conducted preliminary analysis using this five-point Likert scale. However, our study sample is composed of an active, working population, meaning that frequency of reporting problems on the EQ-5D-5L dimensions, particularly the self-care dimension, was low. We therefore explored differences between respondents by using a binary outcome (any versus no problems) for each EQ-5D-5L dimension and chose to focus our analysis on the EQ-5D-5L VAS as this continuous outcome more easily allowed us to identify differences and patterns in reporting by sociodemographic groups. We chose to present outcomes for each EQ-5D-5L health dimension rather than calculate an overall utility score for study participants because we wanted to explore the heterogeneity in responses according to different aspects of health. Furthermore, as one of our main exposures of interest was migrant status, we were concerned about how well the current UK value set would be applicable to our study sample, which has a higher proportion of migrants than the general UK population.</p><p id="Par40">The EQ-5D-5L VAS provides an alternative way to elicit an individual&#x02019;s rating of their own overall current health. The respondent records their perception of their overall current health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled &#x02018;The best health you can imagine&#x02019; (100) and &#x02018;The worst health you can imagine&#x02019; (0). The EQ-5D-5L VAS provides a quantitative measure of an individual&#x02019;s perception of their overall health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

For analysis, the categories were collapsed into five aggregated ethnic groups (White, Asian, Black, Mixed and Other) used by the ONS. We used migrant status (whether the participant was born in the UK or overseas) to split each ethnic group in two, resulting in a ten-level categorical variable (see Table S1, Additional file 1: Supplementary Material). White UK-born was used as the reference group in regression models. For occupational group, participants were asked to select their main job/role from the following categories: medical, nursing, Allied Health Professional (AHP), pharmacy, healthcare scientist, ambulance, dental, optical, administrative and other (see Table S1 for further information).</p><p id="Par43">We also collected data relating to health and lifestyle factors, which may mediate the effects of sociodemographic characteristics on outcome measures. These included number of self-reported long-term conditions (LTCs), smoking status, consumption of alcohol (units per week) and body mass index (BMI, using ethnicity-specific thresholds) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A description of each variable and its derivation can be found in Table S1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par44">We excluded respondents who did not provide information on outcome and exposure variables (i.e. EQ-5D-5L dimensions, EQ-5D-5L VAS, ethnicity and migration status) from the analysis. Categorical variables were summarised as frequencies and percentages, and non-normally distributed continuous covariates as the median and interquartile range (IQR). EQ-5D-5L VAS scores were non-normally distributed. Despite this, we presented plots of VAS scores by age as mean rather than median values, because of the tendency of scores to cluster around values of tens, and to a lesser extent, fives, as observed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. EQ-5D-5L VAS scores have also been summarised using means and standard deviations in numerous other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; our approach therefore facilitates comparison of our results with others. We plotted mean EQ-5D-5L VAS against age band to explore how associations between EQ-5D-5L VAS and other sociodemographic covariates changed by age, as this has been explored by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">We used logistic regression models to explore differences in reporting on the EQ-5D-5L dimensions by sociodemographic, occupational and health and lifestyle variables. We explored how each sociodemographic factor may mitigate the association of other sociodemographic factors by calculating/comparing three levels of odds ratio for the association between each sociodemographic factor and the EQ-5D-5L dimensions (in terms of likelihood of reporting any problems compared to no problems for each EQ-5D-5L dimension). We used univariable logistic regression to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (uORs) and multivariable logistic regression to calculate two sets of adjusted odds ratios (aORs), the first adjusting for all other sociodemographic variables and the second additionally adjusting for health and lifestyle factors likely to be on the causal pathway: alcohol and smoking consumption, BMI and presence of LTCs. Examining the change in aORs between models allows us to see how modifiable factors that may lie along the causal pathway to HRQoL may explain these observed patterns, using a sequential approach to addition of covariates, as used elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As we formulated no a priori hypothesis, we have avoided overreliance on quoting absolute odds ratio values in favour of interpreting general trends.</p><p id="Par46">We used linear regression models to explore differences in reporting EQ-5D-5L VAS scores by sociodemographic, occupational and health and lifestyle variables using the same three-level approach as used for the logistic regression analysis. We tested whether residuals were normally distributed after linear regression of EQ-5D-5L VAS scores by visually inspecting Q-Q plots. Although the resulting pattern indicated a left skewed distribution of the residuals, we elected to proceed with linear regression as our analysis method for EQ-5D-5L VAS as other studies have done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Linear regression is robust to variations in the normal residual assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Importantly, violations of the assumption should not impact the coefficient estimates but could impact statistical tests for whether coefficients are equal to zero (again this is likely to be problematic only in studies with small sample sizes). We elected not to transform our outcome measure to improve the distribution of residuals because this is widely acknowledged to reduce the interpretability of results.</p><p id="Par47">Multiple imputation was used to replace missing data in all logistic and linear regression models. Rubin&#x02019;s Rules were applied to combine parameter estimates and standard errors from 10 imputed dataset into a single set of results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Although indices of deprivation are available for UK countries outside England, these are not directly comparable with the English IMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We therefore elected to code IMD data as missing for those outside England and impute the missing information, as we have done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Public health emergencies such as the pandemic can exacerbate the already elevated levels of stress and mental health challenges experienced by HCWs, as well as presenting additional challenges in adapting quickly to changes in patient volume, mounting demands, clinical roles, new technologies and ways of working, uncertainties, elevated infection risk with limited protective equipment and managing the anxieties of patients and facing uncertainty in how to effectively treat and respond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The pandemic may have impacted different HCW job roles differently, particularly for those in patient-facing roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">It has long been recognised that health is distributed unequally by occupation and socioeconomic status, with those lower on the occupational hierarchy having poorer health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In terms of such hierarchies within the health sector, previous, smaller studies from Europe have reported similar findings, with nurses reporting lower HRQoL than physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We observed the same pattern for other HCW types, with lower psychological wellbeing and work-related quality of life compared to physicians reported for five occupations of the health and social care workforce (nurses, midwives, AHPs, social care workers and social workers) during the pandemic in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. We also found high rates of pain reported by ambulance workers, which concurs with a recent review reporting high levels of back pain and back injuries among these staff due to lifting, working in awkward postures, loading patients into an ambulance and cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">In contrast to normative data where self-reported EQ-5D-5L VAS scores decline with age (Janssen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]), in UK-REACH, mean scores increased with HCW age (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E). This is likely due to sampling bias, as only working HCWs were included in our study population, who are likely to be relatively fit if they continue to work in HCW roles in the older age groups. In agreement with Janssen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we observed that women tended to report more problems for all ages and all levels of deprivation across all EQ-5D-5L dimensions and these differences became more pronounced after adjusting for health and lifestyle factors. Similarly, European studies of healthcare workers undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic found that women were at risk of higher psychological distress and worse quality of life during the first wave of the pandemic (Spain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]) and reported significantly higher scores at secondary traumatisation related to their HCW role than men (Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). Lower self-reported HRQoL by women has been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], with the suggestion that women may perceive and react to health conditions differently from men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">There was no consistent pattern of differences in HRQoL comparing ethnic minority and migrant groups with White UK-born HCWs. Some groups reported markedly better HRQoL for certain metrics than White UK-born HCWs, particularly Black minority groups and Asian non-UK-born HCWs. The heterogeneity in our findings highlights differences in health outcomes of ethnic minority groups by migration status, as we have identified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. This demonstrates the importance of considering the intersection between ethnicity and migration status, particularly in HCWs, given the high proportion of workers from ethnic minority and migrant groups in the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. While there has been research undertaken exploring ethnic differences in HRQoL for conditions such as diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], drawing conclusions is difficult because of inconsistencies in the measurement tools used and ethnic minority groups included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In terms of work-related quality of life, studies of UK health and social care workers have found that respondents with Black ethnic background reported lower scores than White ethnicity respondents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. For the general population, Watkinson et al. reported the first study to document ethnic inequalities in HRQoL in a large, nationally representative English sample, which focussed on older adults (&#x02265;&#x02009;55 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. While study authors have criticised studies that aggregate distinct groups into broader categories because of small sample sizes, despite little or no similarity in health or exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], similar to our findings, even with a large sample allowing for examination of outcomes for the smallest ethnic groups, estimates for some ethnic groups were imprecise.</p><p id="Par66">Our multivariable regression analyses suggested that, for many of the sociodemographic categories and occupational groups investigated, elevated risks of poor HRQoL outcomes compared to the reference group were attenuated by additionally adjusting for health and lifestyle factors. This could reflect potential mediation by these factors. However, notable discrepancies to this pattern were observed for age (EQ-5D-5L VAS scores and EQ-5D-5L anxiety/depression dimension only) and sex (all EQ-5D-5L metrics). For age, this may represent an artefact of sampling bias of older HCWs remaining working in the healthcare system when other staff with lower HRQoL or anxiety/depression may have chosen to leave. There is a consistent pattern of female HCWs having greater odds of reporting lower HRQoL across all measures after adjustment for health and lifestyle factors than male workers. This suggests that lower HRQoL for female HCWs is unlikely solely to be a result of differences in health and lifestyle factors, such as elevated BMI or smoking, or facing a higher burden of long-term conditions.</p><p id="Par67">There are some limitations to our study and analysis. Our present analysis focuses on HRQoL but not to more general aspects of wellbeing and quality of life, but these are the focus of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and for the UK, HCW studies have concentrated on wellbeing, stress, burnout and attrition rather than the full spectrum of physical and mental health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The cross-sectional nature of these baseline data mean we can only comment on associations and not make causal inferences. However, the purpose of our analysis was hypothesis generation rather than proof of causation, for example, Asian overseas-born and Black ethnic minority groups having lower levels of anxiety/depression than White UK-born HCWs and nurses and ambulance workers more frequently experiencing pain/discomfort. Baseline UK-REACH data collection took place in 2020&#x02013;2021 and therefore reflects HCWs&#x02019; opinions and experiences at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK when HCWs&#x02019; workloads were substantially altered, increasing for some and decreasing for others, at a time of uncertainty and anxiety regarding infection risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. HCWs&#x02019; circumstances at the time of questionnaire completion may have influenced their reporting of HRQoL, particularly regarding mental health. Despite the diversity of the study sample, we were unable to recruit large numbers from lower-banded occupations, which may limit the generalisability of our findings to those job roles. Our study of HCWs does not have a comparison group from the general population and so we have used data from an independent study for comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Finally, there is inevitable selection bias within our self-selected cohort, which again may limit generalisability.</p><p id="Par68">There are also a number of strengths of this analysis. The UK-REACH study sample is very large and diverse, ensuring adequate representation of this diverse workforce. While the majority of our study sample were women (75.9%), we nonetheless achieved a higher participation rate from the male workforce than other HCW studies (e.g. Neill et al., 88% women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]), and the male to female ratio of respondents in our study is very similar to an estimate for the wider NHS workforce of 76.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. We achieved a high response rate from ethnic minority and migrant groups: 30% of our study sample were non-White; higher than the 26% in 2022 who were non-White across all NHS staff, for whom ethnicity was known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and higher than proportions achieved in most UK HCW studies (5% in Neill et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]; not reported by Durkin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par69">There is a moral imperative to prioritise and protect all aspects of HRQoL of the healthcare workforce. A high proportion of HCWs in our study reported problems with anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort compared to findings reported elsewhere for the general population. The threat to quality healthcare of these impacts must be minimised. Our findings can be used as a first step to understanding the underlying causes of lower HRQoL among HCWs, particularly in terms of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. Future research should pay particular attention to differences in HRQoL by occupational group and explore why women consistently report lower HRQoL. This better understanding of the causes of poorer health and quality of life among HCWs can we develop appropriate interventions to mitigate these effects and create a healthier, happier healthcare workforce.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
