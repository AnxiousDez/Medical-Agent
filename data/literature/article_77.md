Contact behaviour has traditionally been assessed in cross-sectional surveys and not as part of longitudinal population-based studies which simultaneously measure infection frequency and vaccination coverage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies assessed contact behaviour over longer periods and correlated this to data on immunity. This can inform future dynamic modelling. Here, we assess how contact behaviour varied based on SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination status in two large population-based studies in Germany during 2021.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We assessed direct encounters, separated into household and non-household contacts, in participants of MuSPAD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12,641), a population-based cohort study, and COVIMOD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31,260), a longitudinal contact survey. We calculated mean numbers of reported contacts and fitted negative binomial mixed-effects models to estimate the impact of immunity status, defined by vaccination or previous infection, on contact numbers; logistic mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationship between contact behaviour and seropositivity due to infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Contact numbers varied over the course of the pandemic from 7.6 to 10.8 per 24&#x000a0;h in MuSPAD and 2.1 to 3.1 per 24&#x000a0;h in COVIMOD. The number of non-household contacts was higher in participants who reported previous infections and vaccinations (contact ratio (CR) MuSPAD: 1.22 (95%CI 0.94&#x02013;1.60); COVIMOD: 1.35 (CI 1.12&#x02013;1.62)) compared to unvaccinated and uninfected individuals. Non-household contact numbers were also higher in fully vaccinated participants (MUSPAD: CR 1.15 (CI 1.05&#x02013;1.26); COVIMOD: 1.43 (CI 1.32&#x02013;1.56)) compared to unvaccinated individuals. Compared to individuals without household contacts, the odds for seropositivity due to infection were higher among MuSPAD individuals with three or more household contacts (odds ratio (OR) 1.54 (CI 1.12&#x02013;2.13)) and eleven or more non-household contacts (OR 1.29 (CI 1.01&#x02013;1.65)).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Different contact behaviours based on infection and/or vaccination status suggest that public health policies targeting immunity status may influence the contact behaviour of those affected. A combined assessment of self-reported contacts, infections, and vaccinations as well as laboratory-confirmed serostatus in the population can support modelling of the spread of infections. This could help target containment policies and evaluate the impact of public health measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-025-04211-x.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Covid-19</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Seroprevalence study</kwd><kwd>Social contact survey</kwd><kwd>Social contact behaviour</kwd><kwd>Immunity status</kwd><kwd>Vaccination status</kwd><kwd>Previous infections</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Institute of Epidemiology and Social Medicine, University of M&#x000fc;nster</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01KX2121</award-id><award-id>01KX2121</award-id><award-id>01KX2021</award-id><award-id>MV2021-012</award-id><award-id>01KX2121</award-id><award-id>01KX2021</award-id><award-id>01KX2121</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Helmholtz Zentrum f&#x000fc;r Infektionsforschung, Germany</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009318</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SO-096HZEPiAdHoc &#x00026; LOKI: KA1-Co-08</award-id><award-id>SO-096HZEPiAdHoc &#x00026; LOKI: KA1-Co-08</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program</institution></funding-source><award-id>101003480; 10107382; 101095606</award-id><award-id>101003480; 10107382; 101095606</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>German federal states</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Institute of Medical Epidemiology, Biometry and Informatics, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren e.V.</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Saxonian COVID-19 Research Consortium SaxoCOV</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>458526380</award-id><award-id>458526380</award-id><award-id>458526380</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100023448</institution-id><institution>Robert Koch Institut</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universit&#x000e4;t M&#x000fc;nster (1056)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par24">Contact patterns in the human population are crucial in the transmission of most infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Empirical contact data resulting from scientific monitoring of social interactions is used to inform mathematical models to predict the dynamics of human-to-human infection spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and help to anticipate the impact of control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of direct person-to-person contacts as a decisive factor in containment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. During the pandemic, interpersonal contact reduction measures were initiated by governments worldwide to reduce infectious disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In December 2020, COVID-19 vaccination campaigns began in Germany and initially prioritised the older, comorbid, and occupationally exposed population groups. In parallel to the advancing vaccination campaign in early 2021, the German government repeatedly prolonged the scaling down of public life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In May 2021, with increasing vaccination coverage and declining incidence, contact restrictions were abolished for vaccinated and recently recovered individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In June 2021, vaccination prioritisation was lifted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and in late August, the 2G and 3G rules were implemented, allowing vaccinated and recovered individuals (2G) plus individuals with a negative test result (3G) to gain entrance to additional aspects of public life, such as restaurants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
</p><p id="Par25">The population-based recording of contact behaviour is essential to evaluate the spread of the virus and to assess changes in its transmission related to variations in contact frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Contact surveys traditionally ask specifically about the number, frequency, and degree of intimacy of contacts to assess regular contact behaviour of participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While pre-pandemic contact surveys such as POLYMOD were not very numerous and often only snapshots of short periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the continuous and large-scale contact surveys conducted during the pandemic, e.g. CoMix in Europe and COVIMOD in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], allow a more detailed understanding of how contact behaviour is actually distributed in the population. Furthermore, combining information on contact behaviour and how this varies in individuals with different vaccination and infection statuses enables us to better understand and estimate the potential effectiveness of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions, thus providing substantial value for public health policy. On the other hand, for future epidemic modelling efforts, intra-pandemic surveys have the disadvantage of being confounded by concurrent pandemic measures.</p><p id="Par26">While contact surveys assess contact behaviour in a very detailed manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], typical seroepidemiologic studies have focused on quantifying previously unrecognized or unreported cases and have only assessed rough estimates of contact behaviour in a non-continuous way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Beyond what detailed contact surveys can do, these estimates provide a way to correlate information on contact frequency to population infection frequency, e.g. from seroprevalence estimations. This is why the comparison of information gathered on contacts in contact surveys and seroprevalence surveys during the pandemic is important to underlie modelling of infectious diseases of future epidemics and can also support learning to assess such real-time contact information more efficiently.</p><p id="Par27">Here, we assess differences in social contact behaviour by self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status as well as the association between laboratory-confirmed infection-based seropositivity and contact behaviour by comparing contact data from two population-based studies&#x02014;one traditional contact survey and one seroprevalence study with some contact behaviour information&#x02014;during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par28">The study design and conduct of the MuSPAD study has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In short, during 2020 and 2021, MuSPAD was established as a multicentre study assessing seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with consecutive cross-sectional studies at different locations throughout Germany. It has subsequently been redesigned as an adaptive population-based panel able to rapidly provide infection frequency and immunity estimates for different pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The presented analysis was performed in a subset of the MuSPAD population enrolled between January and August 2021 after the launch of the vaccination campaign (see Additional file 1: Fig. S3.1.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Serological testing at the time of enrolment was done with a multiplex assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] which can distinguish between seropositivity due to infection or vaccination; furthermore, a self-administered questionnaire (online or paper-based) for completion at home collected information on contact behaviour (see Additional file 1: Table S1.1.1).</p><p id="Par29">The COVIMOD study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] is an observational, longitudinal study which collected self-reported data on person-to-person contacts as well as vaccination status and previous SARS-CoV-2 infections during the COVID-19 pandemic via online questionnaires.

The serostatus variable was categorised based on laboratory results, thus revealing (undetected) infection or lack of seroconversion after vaccination and indicating potential protection. By identifying antibodies against spike- (S), receptor-binding domain- (RBD), and nucleocapsid- (NC) proteins, the multiplex assay allowed for the distinction between infection- or vaccine-acquired antibodies since vaccines do not contain an NC component.

While men and women had similar mean contact numbers overall and with respect to immunity status, women with children in the same household had a higher risk of infection, according to serological indicators, than those living without, an effect not seen in men.</p><p id="Par54">Starting in mid-April 2021, partially and fully vaccinated individuals in COVIMOD had an increase in reported contacts compared to non-vaccinated individuals; this coincided with the start of the warm season and occurred near the end of Germany&#x02019;s second lockdown, shortly before some restrictions were lifted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An increase in contact numbers among vaccinated individuals was also observed in MuSPAD beginning in May 2021. This alignment of contact activities with the legal and seasonal context continued to be visible in the autumn period covered by COVIMOD; there was a higher number of contacts among fully vaccinated individuals compared to partially and not vaccinated individuals shortly after the implementation of the 3G and 2G rules, which loosened restrictions for vaccinated, recovered, and sometimes tested persons. Early access to vaccines was restricted to various subgroups of the population, initially targeting those most at risk for a severe COVID-19 disease course (e.g. the elderly) or individuals most at risk of coming into contact with infected individuals (e.g. healthcare workers). By about mid-June 2021, the vaccines were made available to a larger part of the population, until eventually all adults were eligible and able to access the vaccine. Therefore, increased contact among fully vaccinated individuals in the latter half of 2021 cannot be explained by vaccine availability. Overall, the increase in contacts among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals supports the idea that vaccination status impacts the number of contacts individuals have, an observation which was also seen in other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Looking at the immunity status, individuals who reported vaccinations with or without infections also had more contacts than individuals with no reported vaccinations or infections; in MuSPAD, this also applied to individuals with knowledge of infection but no vaccination. Understanding these nuances in contact behaviour by vaccination status and prior infections can be helpful to more accurately model transmission dynamics among different groups. In particular, the inclusion of such behavioural effects would be beneficial in the prediction of the impact of different vaccination strategies on potential burden of disease in ongoing epidemics. This is supported by a previous analysis from COVIMOD showing that contact frequency during the pandemic depended on whether participants belonged to high or low risk groups for severe disease course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">In MuSPAD, participants with a higher average number of contacts also had higher odds of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 anti-NC antibodies; however, in this study, we did not assess frequency of contacts prior to being seropositive. Therefore, in principle this could also reflect the effect of knowledge of previous infection on current contact behaviour. In a sensitivity analysis looking at contact behaviour based on seropositivity together with self-reported knowledge of infection, we found that participants with laboratory-confirmed seropositivity who also reported a previous infection had 1.14 (CI 0.99&#x02013;1.30) times as many non-household contacts as participants with no laboratory-confirmed infection and no reported infection; on the other hand, individuals with laboratory-confirmed seropositivity but no reported previous infection had 0.91 (CI 0.78&#x02013;1.06) times as many non-household contacts as participants with no laboratory-confirmed infection and no reported infection (see Additional file 1: S6). We believe that this warrants further assessment when longitudinal assessments become available (with surveys conducted in 2024). Additionally, a survey design also capturing motivational aspects of contact behaviour informed by the results of a possible qualitative approach to characterise the effect of an individual&#x02019;s immunity status on contact decisions could provide further insight here in the future and help clarify causal links between knowledge of immunity status, contact behaviour, and seroepidemiological status of an individual. The pronounced higher odds of seropositivity for individuals with household contacts compared to those living alone underlines the importance of the living environment in transmission risk, where isolation is difficult, although direct causality cannot be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par57">Drawing conclusions from the comparison of the two distinctly designed and organised studies has clear limitations in terms of different source populations (population registry in MuSPAD; online panel in COVIMOD), different data entry methods (only partly online in MuSPAD; fully online in COVIMOD), different data collection methods (non-household contacts being reported in categories in MuSPAD versus individually in COVIMOD), and different household structures (only 16% of MuSPAD participants lived in single-person households, compared to 36% in COVIMOD, see Additional file 1: Table S3.1.1). We found a relatively large difference in the absolute numbers of contacts, with MuSPAD participants reporting more contacts than COVIMOD participants overall. This is likely due to differences in the questionnaire design and the collection of contact data despite having used adapted shortened data collection instruments from COVIMOD early on in MuSPAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Differences in the wording of contact questions and the offered response formats might have introduced systematic variation in how contacts were reported in both studies. The reporting of non-household contacts in a categorical format as aggregated numbers in MuSPAD might have led to rounding or over-reporting tendencies. On the other hand, the individual reporting structure in COVIMOD might have contributed to under-reporting due to participant fatigue or recall bias. Furthermore, the observed discrepancies in household size between the two cohorts could explain part of the differences in reported contacts.</p><p id="Par58">An additional limitation is that household contacts, which were supposed to imply contact persons actually living in the same household, had several issues with misclassification. Since participants in MuSPAD who reported living alone revealed average household contact numbers above 0, the question was presumably understood differently by at least some of the participants who classified contacts with non-household members as household contacts. Furthermore, MuSPAD participants were asked to report household contacts by their relation (e.g. sister, brother) but were only able to report one contact per category. Therefore, the number of household contacts is likely an underestimate of the true value.</p><p id="Par59">We have directed the analysis towards a causal approach, thereby aiming at the mandate for observational research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, the simultaneous collection of laboratory and questionnaire data in MuSPAD, without assessment of modifications in contact behaviour over the course of the pandemic, makes it difficult to draw a definite causal conclusion about the temporal sequence of vaccination, infection, and contacts. However, since information on self-reported vaccination and infection was collected at the same time as information on contacts, we can assume that participants&#x02019; self-reported vaccination and infection generally predated their contacts, since their assumed vaccination/infection status would have been mostly unchanged during the 24-h time frame of interest for which contact data were collected. In the same context, there is some caveat when comparing contact behaviour over time for MuSPAD, as the MuSPAD data were based on repeated cross-sectional studies of different individuals and did not reflect the behaviour of a longitudinally followed cohort. It is particularly problematic that age groups showed different contact behaviour but represented different proportions of each immunity status stratum throughout the study period.</p><p id="Par60">One of the limitations specific to COVIMOD concerned data collection. Some repeat participants had different individuals fill out the survey in new waves, meaning that an analysis of behavioural differences may be inaccurate since an individual&#x02019;s vaccination status was determined based on answers to current and previous survey waves. This issue was only present in a minority of cases but could bias the results towards null since actual behavioural differences by vaccination status would be masked by incorrectly classified vaccination status. Another limitation comes from COVIMOD being based on an online panel since this raises questions about overall representativeness of the general population, in particular for individuals with less access to the internet.</p><p id="Par61">Analyses based on self-reporting usually overestimate compliance to protective measures by a wide margin compared to observed adherence, and the use of observation methods is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For the information on contact behaviour, a form of social desirability bias might have applied, so future studies using approaches like direct observation could validate our findings. Nonetheless, in view of the difficulty of observational methods for individual contact behaviour, the concise assessment of contact behaviour used here might at least have mitigated a recall bias.</p><p id="Par62">We believe that with these limitations in mind, relative comparisons&#x02014;as done in this study&#x02014;can still be drawn. In future analyses, it would be interesting to quantify the impact of differences in study design methodology and data collection on the estimation of the absolute numbers of contacts, e.g. for different contact settings. This would allow us to more easily integrate findings from different studies, e.g. for dynamic modelling.</p><p id="Par63">The sample sizes of 12,641 participants with a total of 117,514 recorded contacts in MuSPAD and 31,260 entries (from 5,694 individual participants) reporting 82,884 contacts in COVIMOD are to be taken as a strength. In addition, the multi-site approach with random sampling and the extended collection period contributed to a relatively comprehensive recording of contact patterns throughout the German population. By combining data from two studies, we also gain insights into how different approaches in study design yield comparable results. The simultaneous recording of contact behaviour and data on seroprevalence can yield a benefit in informing discussions on infection dynamics and suitable restriction measures.</p><p id="Par64">The use of study populations that aim to be mostly representative for the German population, paired with the finding that both independent studies have similar effects, supports the robustness of the study results and their potential generalisability to the entire German population. However, the study was restricted to individuals aged 18 and over since minors in Germany received a vaccine recommendation much later than adults. Generalisability to other countries and future pandemics may be limited, but since COVIMOD&#x02019;s questionnaire was based on CoMix&#x02014;a social contact study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in 20 European countries&#x02014;and served as a basis for MuSPAD&#x02019;s contact questions, we are better able to compare our results to findings in other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This could also make it easier to compare different government approaches in the future to gain a better understanding of the impact of different regulations on contact behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par65">We found an increased number of contacts among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals. This indicates that vaccination status may influence behaviour. The relationship between combined vaccination and infection status and contact numbers is less clear. In addition, seropositivity due to infection was more common among individuals with more household contacts and among women living with children. The inclusion of behavioural differences in the prediction of the effect of vaccination strategies on potential burden of disease in ongoing epidemics would be beneficial. The real-time joint collection of contact behaviour, self-reported immunity status, and laboratory-based serostatus can be used to align contact dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
