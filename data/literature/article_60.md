Based on its anatomical location, GC can be classified as cardia cancer or non-cardia gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite a decline in recent decades, GC remains the fifth most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, posing a significant global health burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2020, there were an estimated 1.09 million new cases and 770,000 deaths from GC globally, corresponding to age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of 11.1 and 7.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the risk factors for GC, in order to develop effective public health interventions and prevention strategies.</p><p id="Par23">Dental health problems include conditions affecting the teeth and surrounding tissues, such as periodontal disease, gingival inflammation, gum bleeding, tooth decay, and tooth loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A complex interaction between oral microbiota, host immune susceptibility, and environmental factors may lead to pathogenesis of odontogenic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Previous research has suggested a link between odontogenic disease and systematic conditions such as cancers, particularly those of the digestive system, including oral, pancreatic, esophageal, liver, and gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the relationship between specific dental health condition and GC remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study found no causal relationship between tooth loss or periodontal disease and GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis concluded that periodontitis is associated with an increased risk of GC, while other dental problems such as denture wearing, gingivitis, tooth loss, and tooth brushing are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This inconsistency might be due to differences in study populations, exposure measurements, adjusted variables, or insufficient sample sizes. To address these limitations, further large-scale, high-quality prospective studies are needed to examine various dental health conditions and their potential causal relationship with GC.
</p><p id="Par24">Studies examining the relationship between dental health and gastrointestinal malignancies traditionally focus on tooth count, as it is simpler to measure than assessing inflammation or grading its severity in odontogenic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This study used Swedish nationwide registers to explore the impact of both tooth count and dental health problems&#x000a0;on the long-term risk of GC, including its cardia and non-cardia subtypes, in Swedish adults aged 19 and older. Additionally, sibling comparisons were also conducted in our study, which can provide the most direct evidence of the association between dental health and GC through effectively reducing the potential biases arising from familial confounders and other unmeasured factors shared by siblings, including both genetic and environmental influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cohort design and study population</title><p id="Par25">Based on the population-based Dental Health Register (DHR), which contains nationwide coverage of individual data on dental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], this prospective cohort study included Swedish adults aged over 19 years who visited a dentist at least once between 2009 and 2016.

Participants were categorized hierarchically into the following groups: healthy; caries (diagnostic code: 4001, 4002, 4011, and 4012); root canal infection (diagnostic code: 3051); mild inflammation, which includes mucositis (diagnostic code: 3042), pericoronitis (diagnostic code: 3045), gingivitis (diagnostic code: 3041), stomatitis (diagnostic code: 3072 and 3073), and other inflammatory conditions&#x000a0;of the gums and tissues around the teeth (diagnostic code: 3046); and periodontitis (diagnostic code: 3043 and 3044), based on the severity of damage and inflammation in the teeth and surrounding tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. When multiple dental conditions were diagnosed, the most severe condition was prioritized as the baseline exposure, following this hierarchical order of severity (from least to most severe): healthy, dental caries, root canal infection, mild inflammation, and periodontitis. Among these dental health conditions, dental caries is not an inflammatory disease but rather a breakdown of the tooth enamel caused by bacterial metabolic activity. In subsequent interaction&#x000a0;analysis, mild inflammation and periodontitis were categorized as &#x0201c;mild/severe inflammation,&#x0201d; while individuals with healthy teeth, caries, or root canal infection were categorized as &#x0201c;no inflammation/localized inflammation.&#x0201d; Baseline tooth counts were derived from the earliest visit, with longitudinal plausibility checks applied to resolve discrepancies with latter visits. Due to the severely skewed distribution of the tooth counts (i.e., most participants had few missing teeth, while a small subset had many), the number of remaining teeth at baseline was grouped into the following categories:&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;27,&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;24 and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;27,&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;20 and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;24,&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;14 and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;20, and&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;14 teeth, in order to avoid overly sparse strata and ensuring robust statistical inference.

For cohort analyses, cox proportional hazards models using attained age as the timescale were applied to assess the association between dental health condition and the risk of GC, cardia GC and non-cardia GC, and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Schoenfeld residual plots did not show any violations of the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). For sibling-controlled analyses, conditional logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs of GC in association with dental health status, conditioning on sibling groups. Both the cohort and sibling-controlled analyses were performed with adjustment for the aforementioned covariates. Individuals with healthy dental status or more than 27 remaining teeth served as the reference groups. The Cochran-Armitage test was employed to test for a linear trend in the risk of GC across increasingly severe dental health conditions, which ordered as an ordinal variable by clinical severity as healthy, caries, root canal infection, mild inflammation, and periodontitis.</p><p id="Par31">Additionally, we evaluated the potential interaction effect between dental health condition and the number of remaining teeth on the risk of GC by comparing Cox regression models with and without a cross-product term using the analysis of variance test. We also assessed the risk of GC and its subtypes in relation to a combination of dental inflammatory conditions and the number of remaining teeth.

Our findings suggest that individuals with odontogenic inflammation are at higher risk of developing GC, particularly the cardia type. Additionally, we observed a gradual increase in the risk of both cardia and non-cardia GC as the number of remaining teeth decreases. These associations were consistently observed in sibling comparisons, across various sex and age subgroups, and in sensitivity analyses. To our knowledge, this is the largest population-based prospective cohort study and the first to use sibling-controlled analysis to investigate this association, providing significant evidence on the risk factors for gastric carcinogenesis.</p><p id="Par43">The prevalence of dental caries and periodontitis in the study population was relatively low compared to global estimates but aligned with findings from other Swedish registry-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This discrepancy may be attributed to the inherent limitations of the DHR, which excludes individuals with limited access to dental care. Furthermore, the DHR&#x02019;s diagnostic criteria for periodontitis prioritize advanced cases, potentially leading to an underestimation of mild or early-stage disease prevalence. Additionally, Sweden&#x02019;s high rate of dental care utilization and widespread implementation of preventive measures likely contribute to the lower disease prevalence observed compared to the global average.</p><p id="Par44">Previous studies have indicated that poor dental health may contribute to the development of GC.

Our findings align with these studies in demonstrating that odontogenic inflammations are associated with an increased risk of GC, and further reveal a dose-response relationship between the number of remaining teeth and the risk of GC.</p><p id="Par45">While prior research usually focused on tooth count as a simple marker of dental health in relation to GC, these studies have largely overlooked the distinct etiological differences between cardia and non-cardia GC subtypes and have rarely accounted for unmeasured confounding factors, such as familial or genetic influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Notably, to our best knowledge, no prior work has reported subtype-specific associations between dental health indicators and GC risk. Our study addresses this critical issue by demonstrating that lower tooth count is associated with elevated GC risk for both cardia and non-cardia subtypes, while periodontitis exhibits a stronger link to cardia cancer, thereby challenging the assumption of uniform dental health associations across GC subtypes. By employing both cohort design and sibling-controlled analyses&#x02014;which account for shared familial factors (e.g., genetics, early-life environment)&#x02014;our findings strengthen causal inference compared to traditional observational studies. Importantly, this study identifies dental health as a potentially modifiable risk factor for GC, distinct from non-modifiable factors like age or genetics, suggesting that interventions targeting oral hygiene (e.g., periodontal treatment, dental care promotion) could be integrated into preventive strategies, particularly in high-risk populations.</p><p id="Par46">The observed site-specific association between periodontitis and cardia GC, but not non-cardia GC, supports hypotheses regarding anatomical and etiological differences underlying these subtypes. The proximity of the cardia to the oral cavity may facilitate direct exposure to periodontal pathogens or inflammatory mediators, as well as influence by gastroesophageal reflux, whereas non-cardia gastric tumors are more strongly linked to <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection and subsequent gastric mucosal atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, while most of our estimates suggested elevated risks across subtypes, the limited number of non-cardia cases in certain exposure categories likely reduced statistical power, resulting in wider confidence intervals and marginally significant estimates. Furthermore, we observed that root canal infection is associated with higher risk of GC than periodontitis. While we cannot rule out biological plausibility (e.g., chronic endodontic infections may introduce distinct oral-gut microbial or inflammatory pathways), the limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions. While this is the largest cohort study on this topic, future pooled analyses or extended follow-up are needed to enhance statistical power for subgroup analyses and validate findings in underrepresented populations.</p><p id="Par47">Emerging epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that the underlying mechanisms for the association between dental health condition and gastrointestinal cancers are likely intricate and multifaceted, involving alterations in the oral and gut microbiomes, chronic inflammation, and dietary changes due to tooth loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. First, patients with poor dental health often experience changes in microbial diversity of dental plaque and saliva, along with a greater burden of periodontal pathogens, which may promote gastric carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Second, congenital tooth agenesis has been previously linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, which could potentially explain some of the observed associations between missing teeth and GC risk in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Third, long-standing inflammation associated with dental health condition has been proposed as a risk or prerequisite factor in driving GC development, growth, and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Elevated secretion of inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interleukins-1&#x003b1; and -1&#x003b2;, have been observed in GC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, dental health issues, such as caries and periodontal disease, can lead to tooth loss, which might impair chewing ability and alter dietary habits. Insufficient chewing might lead to swallowing large pieces of food, which can irritate or damage the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, ultimately increasing the risk of GC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus, it is biologically plausible that poor dental health could be a significant contributor to the development of GC.</p><p id="Par48">The strengths of our study include its status as the largest prospective cohort study to date on this topic, which provides stronger evidence for a causal relationship. Moreover, the use of sibling controls in the nested case-control analysis effectively mitigates the potential impact of familial confounders and other unmeasured factors shared by siblings. Additionally, dental health information was collected from the Swedish DHR, a comprehensive nationwide database that includes clinical records for nearly all individuals who have visited a dentist in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The CR, which has been widely used in population-based research on cancer incidence and survival, is recognized for its high reliability and completeness in previous studies, with approximately 99% of cases verified and minimal underreporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Both the DHR and CR utilize ICD codes for disease diagnoses, ensuring greater accuracy and reliability compared to self-reported data.</p><p id="Par49">However, several limitations should be acknowledged in our study. First, our data were obtained from multiple Swedish nationwide registers, which did not include information on some important lifestyle factors, such as diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking. This limitation prevented us from directly adjusting for these factors. We used proxies for alcohol and smoking in our analyses to address this issue as much as possible. Further research with more detailed information on these potential confounders is needed. Second, the development of cancer can take many years, even more than a decade. Although our study had a mean follow-up time of 6.36 years, it may not have been long enough to identify long-term GC risk associated with poor oral health. However, the minimal changes in effect estimates in our sensitivity analysis after excluding GC cases diagnosed within 2 years suggest that reverse causality is unlikely to explain our findings. Third, our study did not include individuals with limited access to dental care (e.g., non-attenders due to socioeconomic barriers or rural residency), which could underestimate true population-level prevalence. However, previous studies have reported high coverage rates for the Dental Health Register used in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], suggesting that this issue is unlikely to substantially affect the accuracy of our estimates. Fourth, this study could not account for the impact of dental treatments, such as periodontal therapy, fillings, and preventive care, which may modify inflammatory burden and confound associations. Additionally, although our effect estimates were weighted by follow-up time of the individuals, we were not able to directly assess the relationship between the duration of dental inflammation and GC risk, as the exact onset time of these chronic and largely irreversible conditions could not be retrospectively determined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">This population-based cohort study, supplemented&#x000a0;with sibling-controlled analyses, provides novel evidence that lower tooth count is associated with an increased risk of GC, with similar associations observed for both cardia and non-cardia subtypes. Additionally, among the odontogenic diseases evaluated, periodontitis emerged as a stable risk factor for gastric cancer, particularly for the cardia subtype. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms for these associations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
