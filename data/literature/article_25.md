Despite advancements in acute stroke management and secondary prevention strategies, the prognosis for many patients remains guarded, with a considerable proportion experiencing adverse outcomes including death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A critical challenge in managing ischemic stroke is the early identification of patients who are at high risk of poor outcomes, thereby enabling tailored therapeutic interventions and more vigilant monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this context, biomarkers have emerged as promising tools to refine prognostic models and guide clinical decision-making.</p><p id="Par27">One biomarker that has attracted considerable attention is N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Originally recognized for its role in diagnosing and managing heart failure, NT-proBNP is a peptide released predominantly by ventricular myocardial cells in response to increased wall stress. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP have been widely documented in conditions characterized by cardiac dysfunction, and its measurement has become integral to cardiovascular risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, beyond its established role in cardiology, emerging evidence suggests that NT-proBNP may also have significant prognostic value in patients with ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
</p><p id="Par28">The biological rationale for the association between NT-proBNP and ischemic stroke outcomes is multifaceted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Stroke and cardiac dysfunction are intrinsically linked; many patients with ischemic stroke have underlying cardiac pathologies, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure, that predispose them to cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In such cases, elevated NT-proBNP levels may reflect not only cardiac stress but also the severity of cerebral vascular insult. Moreover, the peptide&#x02019;s release may be triggered by acute hemodynamic changes following a stroke, with systemic responses that exacerbate neurological injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This interconnection between the heart and brain highlights the potential utility of NT-proBNP as an integrated marker of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Several studies have indicated that higher NT-proBNP levels in the acute phase of stroke are associated with more severe neurological deficits and increased risk of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These observations have spurred interest in evaluating NT-proBNP as a prognostic marker, with the aim of improving risk stratification in the acute care setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. By identifying patients with elevated NT-proBNP levels, clinicians may be better positioned to anticipate complications, optimize resource allocation, and implement more aggressive therapeutic strategies when necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In essence, NT-proBNP could serve as an early warning signal, flagging those individuals who require enhanced surveillance and possibly more intensive management to mitigate the risk of early mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Beyond its prognostic implications, NT-proBNP offers practical advantages in the clinical arena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The assay for NT-proBNP is widely available, rapid, and relatively cost-effective, making it an attractive option for incorporation into routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The ease of measurement means that NT-proBNP could potentially be integrated into early diagnostic protocols for stroke patients, complementing clinical assessments and imaging findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This integration could lead to a more comprehensive evaluation of a patient&#x02019;s overall risk profile, encompassing both neurological and cardiac dimensions of the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Furthermore, the relationship between NT-proBNP levels and mortality in ischemic stroke may also provide insights into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Elevated NT-proBNP may not only be a marker of cardiac strain but also an indicator of systemic stress responses that influence neurovascular integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For instance, higher levels of NT-proBNP could reflect a state of neurohormonal activation that contributes to inflammatory cascades, endothelial dysfunction, and ultimately, poorer outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Understanding these pathways could open new avenues for therapeutic intervention, potentially leading to strategies aimed at modulating NT-proBNP levels or mitigating their downstream effects.</p><p id="Par32">Although NT-proBNP has been extensively studied in the context of cardiovascular diseases, its role in ischemic stroke remains an area of active investigation. Several observational studies have reported that elevated NT-proBNP levels are associated with increased mortality in stroke patients. However, it is important to recognize that NT-proBNP is primarily a marker of cardiac stress and may be elevated in patients with preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities. Moreover, although other biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and neurofilament light chain protein are also relevant for stroke prognostication, direct comparative analyses were not feasible due to data limitations. Our study focuses solely on NT-proBNP to provide a comprehensive summary of its prognostic accuracy for mortality in acute ischemic stroke, thereby complementing existing literature and highlighting areas for future research. Hence, this review was done to determine the accuracy of NT-proBNP for predicting mortality amongst patients with ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par33">Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par34">Population: Adult patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke, confirmed by neuroimaging modalities.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Index Test:&#x000a0;Measurement of either BNP or NT-proBNP levels using validated immunoassays performed during the acute or subacute phase of stroke.

Prior literature indicates that BNP and NT-proBNP have comparable prognostic performance in predicting mortality among acute ischemic stroke patients. Therefore, we pooled data from studies reporting either biomarker and conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate any potential impact of this methodological decision on our pooled estimates.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Target Condition:&#x000a0;Main outcomes are mortality occurring after an ischemic stroke.

However, only subgroups with a minimum of four studies (i.e., in-hospital and 3-month mortality) were analyzed separately. All the studies were prospective in nature, making the subgroup analysis based on study design not possible.

Across the included studies, both sensitivity and specificity showed moderate to high values, suggesting that elevated NT-proBNP levels can be a clinically relevant indicator of increased risk. Specifically, the overall pooled estimates demonstrated that NT-proBNP offered balanced sensitivity and specificity in the short term, as well as robust discriminative ability over longer follow-up periods. The short-term (in-hospital) subgroup displayed a slightly higher sensitivity but lower specificity, whereas the 3-month subgroup, although marginally less sensitive, provided a greater specificity and area under the ROC curve. Taken together, these findings underscore NT-proBNP&#x02019;s potential to refine risk stratification in stroke management protocols, highlighting its value as a biomarker that can guide the intensity of clinical monitoring and post-discharge planning.</p><p id="Par78">The review further indicates that the effect of NT-proBNP testing on posttest probability is non-negligible, shifting the likelihood of adverse outcomes significantly in both positive and negative test scenarios. Although the positive likelihood ratio suggests that NT-proBNP alone may not definitively confirm the risk of mortality, its negative likelihood ratio is comparatively stronger for excluding mortality risk. Additionally, the review observed substantial heterogeneity among studies, yet little of this variability was attributable to threshold effects. These findings are important because they show that differences in cut-off values do not fully explain the variability in NT-proBNP performance across diverse study populations and settings. The meta-analysis also found that the short-term versus longer-term follow-up window influenced the sensitivity and specificity estimates, an insight that could be vital for clinicians deciding when and how to use NT-proBNP measurements in their practice. Moreover, although the funnel plot showed mild asymmetry, the lack of statistical significance suggests that publication bias may not be a serious concern, albeit the p-value is borderline.</p><p id="Par79">Previous individual studies have reported an association between elevated NT-proBNP and higher mortality or worse functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Some earlier investigations primarily examined BNP, which shares a common biological pathway with NT-proBNP, and found similarly promising results in identifying cardiac dysfunction or predicting stroke prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The pooled estimates in the present meta-analysis generally align with those earlier findings, suggesting that NT-proBNP measurement adds prognostic value above and beyond clinical parameters alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Specifically, past single-center studies often emphasized that NT-proBNP had strong negative predictive utility, meaning that lower levels could help rule out severe adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our pooled estimates confirm this negative predictive characteristic, although we also observed a meaningful positive predictive shift that may assist clinicians in flagging high-risk patients for closer monitoring.</p><p id="Par80">A notable difference from some older studies is the relatively high specificity identified in our 3-month subgroup. Prior literature sometimes struggled to show consistency in specificity values, partly due to varied sample sizes, different inclusion criteria, and differences in how outcomes were defined. By restricting subgroup analyses to well-defined time windows, our review provides more nuanced insights into how NT-proBNP performance might vary as the time horizon extends beyond the acute phase. In this sense, the meta-analysis offers a clearer picture than many previous individual studies, which often lacked the statistical power or design uniformity to tease apart short-term from longer-term performance.</p><p id="Par81">Furthermore, although some older trials posited that heterogeneity in NT-proBNP thresholds might limit the biomarker&#x02019;s clinical utility, our findings indicate that threshold variation alone is not the principal driver of between-study differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This resonates with recent observational data suggesting that a host of factors&#x02014;such as stroke etiology, comorbid cardiac disease, and timing of sample collection&#x02014;can influence NT-proBNP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The minimal role of threshold effects in explaining heterogeneity implies that future research might better focus on standardizing patient characteristics and timing of biomarker sampling, rather than converging on a single universal cut-off. This perspective is consistent with emerging stroke literature, where personalized risk stratification is increasingly advocated, and biomarkers like NT-proBNP are viewed as one piece of a larger prognostic puzzle.</p><p id="Par82">The elevated NT&#x02010;proBNP levels observed in acute ischemic stroke likely reflect an interplay of neurohormonal, inflammatory, and hemodynamic responses that occur during and after cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Ischemic stroke induces a state of acute stress that activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers the release of natriuretic peptides from the myocardium. This response may be accentuated in patients with underlying subclinical cardiac dysfunction or atrial fibrillation, conditions known to increase wall stress and myocardial strain. Moreover, reperfusion therapies, while essential for salvaging brain tissue, can themselves contribute to myocardial injury or exacerbate cardiac stress, further elevating NT&#x02010;proBNP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This biomarker, therefore, appears to serve as an integrative indicator of both the severity of cerebral ischemia and the heart&#x02019;s response to stress, ultimately correlating with higher mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">It is important to note that few individual studies reported prognostic performance estimates that diverged from the rest of the studies. For example, Zhang (2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] demonstrated an unusually high sensitivity, while Aydin (2020) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Manoj (2024) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported notably high specificity. These discrepancies may be attributable to several factors. Differences in patient population characteristics&#x02014;such as variations in stroke severity, etiology, and underlying cardiovascular comorbidities&#x02014;could significantly influence NT&#x02010;proBNP levels and thereby affect its predictive performance. Additionally, variations in the timing of NT&#x02010;proBNP measurement and differences in treatment protocols (including use of reperfusion therapies) may also contribute to these extreme values. Lastly, the methodology for determining NT&#x02010;proBNP cut-off values, often based on post hoc ROC analysis, may introduce variability that reflects sample-specific characteristics rather than standardized thresholds. Future research should further elucidate these aspects to better define the clinical utility of NT&#x02010;proBNP across diverse patient subgroups.</p><p id="Par84">The strengths of our review lie in its comprehensive and methodologically rigorous approach. By systematically identifying and pooling data from 11 prospective studies conducted across diverse geographic regions, our analysis benefits from a broad representation of the AIS patient population. The inclusion criteria were consistently defined across studies, and outcomes were ascertained using standardized neuroimaging and clinical criteria, thereby enhancing the reliability of our pooled estimates. The stratification of outcomes based on different follow-up durations further allowed us to discern variations in the prognostic performance of NT&#x02010;proBNP over time. However, the review is not without limitations. Notable heterogeneity exists among the studies, as evidenced by considerable I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] values, although threshold effects appear minimal. A significant limitation is the fact that most studies derived NT&#x02010;proBNP cut-off values post hoc using ROC analysis rather than pre-specifying them, which introduces a high risk of bias in the index test domain. Additionally, variations in sample size, follow-up duration, and patient characteristics may confound the generalizability of our findings. Inconsistent reporting of stroke severity and possible variations in utilized assays across studies limited our ability to adjust or perform subgroup analysis and incorporate this outcome into our analysis. Finally, while publication bias was assessed and found to be inconclusive, the possibility that negative or inconclusive results remain unpublished cannot be entirely dismissed.</p><p id="Par85">The implications for clinical practice are significant. NT&#x02010;proBNP testing could be integrated into the routine evaluation of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke to enhance early risk stratification. Given that a positive NT&#x02010;proBNP result increases the posttest probability of mortality, clinicians could use this information to identify high-risk patients who might benefit from more intensive monitoring, earlier intervention, or tailored post-discharge planning. Conversely, a negative result, which markedly reduces the likelihood of adverse outcomes, could reassure clinicians and help avoid unnecessary invasive interventions. Furthermore, incorporating NT&#x02010;proBNP levels into multimodal prognostic models alongside traditional clinical variables such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale could refine decision-making in both acute and subacute phases of stroke management. Ultimately, the use of NT&#x02010;proBNP as a prognostic biomarker might contribute to improved allocation of healthcare resources and better patient outcomes by facilitating targeted therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par86">Our findings also underscore several recommendations for future research. First, prospective multicenter studies with larger and more homogeneous patient populations are needed to confirm the prognostic value of NT&#x02010;proBNP and to establish standardized cut-off values. Future studies should aim to pre-specify NT&#x02010;proBNP thresholds based on rigorous validation cohorts to reduce bias introduced by data-driven cut-off selection. Second, research should investigate the additive value of NT&#x02010;proBNP in combination with other biomarkers and clinical scoring systems, which could yield more robust predictive models. Exploring the temporal dynamics of NT&#x02010;proBNP by conducting serial measurements could also provide insights into how changes in this biomarker correlate with evolving clinical status and long-term outcomes. Finally, randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of NT&#x02010;proBNP-guided interventions on clinical outcomes could determine whether this biomarker not only predicts risk but also informs therapeutic decision-making that improves patient prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par87">Our review provides evidence that higher NT&#x02010;proBNP levels are associated with an increased risk of mortality, both in the short-term in-hospital setting and over a longer 3-month follow-up period. Despite inherent heterogeneity among the included studies and the limitations related to post hoc threshold determination, NT&#x02010;proBNP testing appears to meaningfully shift the posttest probability of adverse outcomes. These findings support the potential incorporation of NT&#x02010;proBNP into clinical protocols for risk stratification and management of AIS patients. However, further research is warranted to standardize measurement practices, validate optimal cut-off values, and evaluate the benefits of NT&#x02010;proBNP-guided interventions in improving clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
