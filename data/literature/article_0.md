One study outcome was data sharing plans in the trial registration platform, where trials clearly responding a &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Plan to share&#x0201d; were considered as planning to share data (including study protocols, statistical analysis plans, analytic codes, and individual participant data). The concordance between registered and published plans to share data was also assessed, which included plans to either share data (Yes/Yes) and not to share data (No/No) in both registration and publications. Univariate analyses were used to assess associations between trial characteristics and registered plans to share data and between trial characteristics and concordance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Of the 383 included registration IDs, only 44.6% (171/383) planned to share data in registration.

There were seven trial publications, each pooling two trials and having two registration IDs. We selected the registration IDs with a later start date, resulting in 376 trial publications for concordance assessment. Over half (216/376, 57.4%) had discordance between registration and publications. COVID-19-related trials were associated with decreased odds of data sharing concordance (<italic>OR</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.59, 95% <italic>CI</italic>: 0.37, 0.91). Additionally, significant discordance was consistently found in statistical analysis plans or study protocols, analytic codes, and individual participant data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par6">Most registered trials do not specify plans to share data.

The trial registration platform <italic>ClinicalTrials.gov</italic> has added a component of &#x0201c;Plan to share IPD&#x0201d; for trial authors when registering clinical trials since 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To further enhance data sharing, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommended that trial authors must specify a plan to share data for trials registered from January 2019 onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, a statement as to whether data are planned to be shared, and if so how, became a mandatory element on some registry platforms to align with the ICMJE recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].
</p><p id="Par22">A previous survey investigating clinical trials primarily sponsored by China&#x02019;s institutions found an increase in responding to the question about whether data would be shared in registration platforms after 2016, yet no significant change in the proportion of trials indicating &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; to share data was observed from 2016 to 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, the current practice of plans to share data in clinical trial registration and the evolving impact of ICMJE recommendations on trial registration are largely unknown. Moreover, the concordance between registered and published plans to share data is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While trial registration can improve reporting transparency, there may be discordance between what is registered and subsequently published in peer-reviewed manuscripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For instance, some trials explicitly indicated &#x0201c;Yes&#x0201d; to the &#x0201c;Plan to share data&#x0201d; option in their registration platforms; however, their subsequent data sharing statements from publications indicated that their data would not be shared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Exploring the discordance between registered and published plans to share data is therefore important to advance our understanding of data sharing reporting transparency and consistency.
</p><p id="Par23">Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the current practice of plans to share data in trial registration platforms and explored the concordance between what was registered and what was published in trial publications. We also evaluated the associations between trial characteristics and plans to share data in trial registration and between trial characteristics and the concordance between registered and published plans to share data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par24">We reported this study according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This study was registered on the Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/k6etb">https://osf.io/k6etb</ext-link>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Search strategy and eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par25">We first identified the top 10 medical general journals that frequently published clinical trials and were ranked by journal impact factor in the category of &#x0201c;Medicine, General &#x00026; Internal&#x0201d; based on Journal Citation Reports (as of June 2023). After excluding those journals that primarily focused on basic science or published less than 10 clinical trials annually, a total of 6 journals were chosen, including <italic>The Lancet</italic>, <italic>The New England Journal of Medicine (New Engl J Med)</italic>, <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</italic>, <italic>British Medical Journal (BMJ)</italic>, <italic>JAMA Internal Medicine</italic>, and <italic>Annals of Internal Medicine (Ann Intern Med)</italic>. Subsequently, we searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) to systematically retrieve clinical trials published in these journals (Additional file 1: Table S1 shows the search strategy used). Given that ICMJE required a data sharing plan in trial registration from Jan 2019 onwards, we only included trials that started participant enrollment on or after Jan 1, 2019, and trial publications published between Jan 1, 2021, and Dec 31, 2023, to allow sufficient time and samples of trials for evaluation. We included clinical trial publications with primary results; methods papers, publications of secondary results, relevant reviews, commentaries, perspectives, or editorials were excluded. The detailed selection process is presented in Additional file 1: Fig. S1.</p><p id="Par26">If the same trial was registered on different platforms, we only extracted and analyzed information from <italic>ClinicalTrials.gov</italic>. Some publications may pool different trials for analysis, thereby having&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;two registration identifiers (IDs). We treated such publications as different trials by their corresponding registration IDs for data extraction and analysis; i.e., each registration ID represented an individual trial. Some publications with updated data may share the same registration ID with prior publications; in this case, the most recent publication was kept for analysis to avoid double counting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study outcomes</title><p id="Par27">The outcomes were the inclusion of a plan to share data in the trial registration and the concordance between registered and published plans to share data.</p><p id="Par28">Trials that clearly responded with a &#x0201c;Yes&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Plan to share&#x0201d; in registration were considered as planning to share data, while those reporting with a &#x0201c;No&#x0201d; were considered as not planning to share data. In this study, the data that were planned to share included study protocols, statistical analysis plans, analytic codes, and IPD, where trials reporting a plan to share any of these data were considered to &#x0201c;plan to share data&#x0201d; in registration. We searched trial registration platforms based on registration IDs to determine the stated plan to share data. If a trial had multiple registration records, we used the latest registration record before the trial publication was published. On the registration platform, all information on the data sharing plan description was extracted, including plans to share IPD and supporting information (study protocols, statistical analysis plans, and analytic codes). If the question &#x0201c;Plan to share IPD&#x0201d; was left blank or answered &#x0201c;Undecided,&#x0201d; responses were pooled as &#x0201c;undecided/missing&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par29">We further explored the data sharing concordance between registered and published plans to share. From data sharing statements in trial publications, trials that clearly stated a willingness to share data were defined as published plans to share data. We also treated trials as having published plans to share data if a link to a data repository was provided, even if the shared data were accessible only after the user registered and signed a data use agreement. Trials that were unwilling to share data or did not report/obtain data sharing statements were considered not to have a published plan to share. Subsequently, data sharing concordance was assessed: (1) plan to share data in registration and publication (both Yes in registration and publication, i.e., &#x0201c;Yes/Yes&#x0201d;) and (2) no plan to share data in registration and publication (both No in registration and publication, i.e., &#x0201c;No/No&#x0201d;). Discordance between registered and published plans to share data included (1) plan to share data in registration but no plan to share data in the publication (Yes in registration but No in publication, i.e., &#x0201c;Yes/No&#x0201d;) and (2) no plan to share in registration but a plan to share in publication (No in registration but Yes in publication, i.e., &#x0201c;No/Yes&#x0201d;). Seven trial publications pooled two trials/registration IDs in which case the registration IDs with a later study start date were used to assess data sharing concordance.</p><p id="Par30">We also assessed the details of the data sharing plans, which are elaborated in registration platforms and statements in trial publications. Therefore, the specific information extracted included the following: (1) data sharing content (analytic code, statistical analysis plan or study protocol, IPD), (2) data access time after publication or trial completion (&#x0003c;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;months,&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;months, unclear), and (3) data access method (public, private, unclear). If trial authors clearly stated that the shared data would be publicly available, we considered the trials to have a public data access method. If the shared data were only available from trial authors, funders, or trial review committees after review, trials were grouped to have a private data access method. Trials were categorized as having an unclear data access method if no relevant details were provided regarding how the trial authors would share data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data extraction</title><p id="Par31">Data extraction and coding were completed independently by four study authors in pairs (J. Z. and X. B., Y.L., and G. L.). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion between the study authors and, if no consensus could be reached, resolved through consultation with the senior author (D. M.).</p><p id="Par32">Data on trial characteristics from registration platforms were extracted, including whether the trial was multicenter, country of origin, design information (with or without control group, parallel or crossover, with or without randomization), trial phase (1&#x02013;2, or 3&#x02013;4), planned sample size, intervention type (drug or other, where &#x0201c;drug&#x0201d; included both drug alone or drug in combination with non-drug), whether the trial was COVID-19-related, and funding source (industry or other, where &#x0201c;industry&#x0201d; included industry alone or the combination of industry and non-industry funder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For those that did not report a trial phase, they were classified as phase 3&#x02013;4 if they planned to enroll&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;400 participants and grouped as phase 1&#x02013;2 if the planned sample size was&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;400 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">We predefined data extraction from trial publications, where the extracted data included the year of publication, whether trial publication mentioned authors&#x02019; conflict of interest (yes or no), and the risk of bias (ROB). If the trial publication mentioned authors&#x02019; conflict of interest, we further categorized the conflict of interest as either financial, non-financial, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We did not aim to assess the ROB for each outcome of the included trials; therefore, the ROB 1.0 tool was used to evaluate the overall ROB for individual trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Results from using the two types of discordance as separate control groups were also consistent with the main findings in general (Additional file 1: Table S6). For the sensitivity analyses by removing 78 trials with undecided/missing plans and treating them as having registered plans to share data, the percentages of the concordance became 64.7% (Yes/Yes: 52.0%, No/No: 12.7%) and 65.9% (Yes/Yes: 55.8%, No/No: 10.1%), respectively (Additional file 1: Table S7).</p><p id="Par48">Additional file 1: Fig. S3 displays the counts of trials that registered and published plans to share data by data sharing content.

It was found that more than half of trials published in high-profile journals did not plan to share data in registration, and over 40% were discordant between registration and publication plans. Trials with an intervention of drug were associated with increased odds of registered plans to share data, while COVID-19-related trials were related to lower odds of concordance. Additionally, significant discordance was consistently found for specific data sharing contents, including statistical analysis plans, study protocols, analytic codes, and individual participant data.</p><p id="Par50">There were over 20% of trials with undecided/missing plans to share data in registration. This highlights the need for awareness and education of trial authors about the value of data sharing and its consideration during trial planning. A previous study that included all trials registered in the 6&#x000a0;months preceding the ICMJE registration requirement (January 2019) found that only 5.5% reported data sharing plans in <italic>ClinicalTrials.gov</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our study observed that 45% of trials registered to share data, possibly reflecting temporal improvements after the ICMJE recommendation was issued. Nevertheless, we only included six high-profile journals for assessment and may overestimate the current practice of data sharing in registration.</p><p id="Par51">Trials with drug interventions received close attention regarding data sharing and reporting transparency, partly explaining a significant association between trials with drug interventions and increased odds of the plan to share data in registration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of note, sharing IPD from phase 1 trials is not required or anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], consistent with our finding of a lower proportion of plans to share data in phase 1 trials when compared with phase 2&#x02013;4 trials, as demonstrated in our post hoc analysis: 38.9% (7/18) vs 44.9% (164/365), respectively.</p><p id="Par52">Concerns about the challenges of data sharing, including participant privacy, necessary additional financial resources, funders&#x02019; expectations, and personal interest, may be significant barriers to adhering to data sharing plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In addition, trial authors may change their data sharing statements in publications from plans aiming to cater to journals&#x02019; implicit expectation or to preserve their advantage of future research output, among others. Notably, the ICMJE recommended that any change in planning to share data should be updated in the registration record and reflected in and consistent with statements in trial publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the ICMJE requirement, we found discordant data sharing plans in over 40% of trials, a finding that requires attention to increase consistency and reliability. Compliance is difficult, however, in that updating one element requires updating the entire registration record, at least on <italic>ClinicalTrials.gov</italic>. Given that discordant data sharing plans in this study result, we recommend ICMJE reassess that expectation (i.e., very late changes to the registration record). While available, accessing prior registration records and identifying relevant changes are burdensome.</p><p id="Par53">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has suggested that SAPs and trial protocols should be publicly available at the time of publishing any summary trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], especially given that analytic codes, SAPs, and protocols could help identify and prevent inappropriate analysis and selective or biased reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, an earlier survey reported a low percentage of cancer trial publication statements willing to share analytic code (12/274, 4.4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This low percentage is consistent with our findings of the plan to share analytic codes both in registration (20/383, 5.2%) and in trial publications (25/376, 6.6%; Additional file 1: Fig. S3). More importantly, a substantial decline in planning to share SAP/study protocol from registration to publication was observed. While previous studies focused on the declaration to share IPD or the comparison between declared and actual data sharing, we recognize a wide gap between registered and published plans to share analytic codes and SAPs/protocols. Efforts are thus required to enhance the concordance of relevant sharing contents (including analytic code, SAP/study protocol, and IPD) for reporting transparency and consistency.</p><p id="Par54">Promptly sharing data had been strongly advocated during public health emergencies and pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, we found no difference between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 trials in planning to share data in registration, similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, COVID-19-related trials were associated with decreased odds of data sharing concordance, possibly due to researchers&#x02019; increased concerns about losing research output and patients&#x02019; sensitization to data privacy as the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly progressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. While one survey in 2021 reported that only 2.7% of COVID-19 trials had discordance between trial registration and published data sharing statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], we observed a substantially higher proportion of trials with data sharing discordance. The small discordance reported from this previous survey may be because it only included trials published at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Jun 2020) and did not include data from the evolving pandemic nor the impact of ICMJE recommendation.</p><p id="Par55">Many organizations, academic institutions, and pharmaceutical companies have developed internal data sharing policies to make their research data publicly or privately available within a reasonable time frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, our study found that a sizable proportion of trials did not specify data access methods or timing in registration or in publications. Significant discordance was also detected in data access methods, comparing registered with published plans to share data. This again reflects an important gap in the reporting transparency of data sharing in clinical trials.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Research implications</title><p id="Par56">The ICMJE recommendation was an important step in promoting data sharing in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; we demonstrate, however, that further attention to whether and how data sharing plans are described in registration and in publications is needed, even in trials published in high-profile journals. Trial registration platforms may consider a more structured and standardized approach to guide the reporting of data sharing plans. Endeavors to promote awareness of journals and trial authors are also needed for completing and/or updating the plan to share data at trial registration, including data sharing content, data access time, and method. Moreover, incorporating recommendations for data sharing plans into future SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) iterations may help improve reporting transparency, consistency, and reliability of data sharing plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p id="Par57">Our study systematically surveyed the current practice of data sharing plans in registration of clinical trials and in publications in order to identify areas of needed improvement and enhance data sharing reporting transparency and reliability and, ultimately, data sharing itself. Study results were strengthened by rigorous methodology and comprehensive analyses.</p><p id="Par58">Several limitations should be noted. First, this cross-sectional study did not assess temporal changes in trial registration, because we only analyzed the last registration record prior to the trial publication date. Our analysis only included trials published in high-profile journals, which may underestimate the discordance between registered and published data sharing plans and thus weaken the generalizability of our findings. We classified trials without a reported trial phase using a cut-off sample size of 400 participants, potentially introducing misclassification in the subgroup analysis. Moreover, while this study aimed to evaluate the reporting transparency of plans to share data in registration and in trial publications, we did not contact trial authors to assess whether the data had been shared. Further research is needed to explore the causes and mechanisms of data sharing discordance between registered and published plans to share data. In addition, due to the small sample size of the included trials, we did not perform statistical tests to explore whether there were significant temporal trends in proportions of trials with plans to share data in registration and data sharing concordance by country of trial origin and journal. The association analysis results from this study were hypothesis-generating of an exploratory nature, given the potential for residual or unmeasured confounding and biases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par59">Most registered clinical trials published in high-profile journals do not specify a plan to share data.
