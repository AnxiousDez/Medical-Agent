We prospectively monitored physical and mental health-related QoL over time in people with TB in the Southern African region with a high HIV and TB burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">Adults aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;15 years with pulmonary TB were enrolled in five cohorts in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe from October 2022 to September 2024. We assessed six QoL outcomes using validated instruments at the start (baseline), end of treatment, and 6 months post-treatment: symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), mental and physical health (SF-12 mental, SF12-MC, SF-12 physical component, SF12-PC), physical fitness (6-Minute Walk Test, 6MWT; 1-min Sit-To-Stand Test, STST), and respiratory health (Saint-George-Respiratory-Questionnaire, SGRQ). Missing QoL scores were imputed with multivariate imputation by chained equations. We compared the proportion of participants with impaired QoL, defining impairment based on outcome-specific cut-off values. We also estimated changes in QoL scores and examined their associations with baseline characteristics using Bayesian multivariable regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par16">We included 1438 participants with a median follow-up of 344 days (interquartile range [IQR] 183&#x02013;373). The median age was 39 years (IQR 30&#x02013;50); 67% were male, and 39% living with HIV. At baseline, 49% had symptoms of depression, 73% had impaired mental health and 92% impaired physical health-related QoL, 68&#x02013;74% had reduced physical fitness (68%: 6MWT, 74%: STST), and 78% impaired respiratory health. All QoL outcomes improved by the end of treatment, notably depressive symptoms (48% to 5%), mental health-related QoL (73% to 28%), and respiratory health (78% to 11%). Most QoL impairments continued to decrease post-treatment, especially physical and respiratory health; depressive symptoms remained below 5%. Across QoL domains and study visits, better outcomes were associated with age&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;30 (83% probability), and worse outcomes with female gender (86%) and a prior TB history (89%). Living with HIV and alcohol drinking were associated with worse QoL only at baseline (88% and 87%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par17">TB negatively impacts QoL across physical, mental, and social domains, including post-treatment.

In 2023, an estimated 10.8 million people fell ill with TB globally, resulting in 1.25 million deaths, including 161,000 people living with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The chronic disease, stigma, discrimination, and economic impact associated with TB contribute to a deterioration in the quality of life (QoL) of people with TB, both physically and mentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, people who have completed TB treatment may continue to suffer from long-term physical and mental complications&#x02014;an additional burden that has long been underestimated and remains poorly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Studies have shown that the QoL of people with TB is generally worse than that of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are highly prevalent among people with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], especially among those with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, post-TB lung disease defined as a chronic respiratory abnormality at least partially attributable to previous pulmonary TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] is estimated to affect 60% to 90% of people who were treated for TB, affecting their QoL, including physically and mentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In terms of mortality, people treated for TB have an almost threefold increased risk of dying after treatment compared with matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Altogether, the post-TB complications in terms of morbidity, mortality, and impaired QoL contribute significantly to the overall burden of TB disease. There is a need for a better understanding of these complications that integrates both mental and physical health aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Existing studies often lack comprehensive longitudinal data that track multiple aspects of QoL from the initiation of treatment to the post-treatment period across diverse settings. Here, we investigated the evolution of physical and mental health-related QoL before, during, and after TB treatment in a prospective cohort of people with TB in five high-burden HIV and TB countries in Southern Africa.

We included the cohort data available on January 30, 2025. TB was either bacteriologically confirmed (e.g. using Xpert Ultra or lipoarabinomannan urine tests) or clinically diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and chest X-ray results. TB treatment and other diseases, including mental health, were managed according to local guidelines. We followed cohort participants with study visits at the time of TB treatment start (baseline), end of treatment (usually 6&#x000a0;months after treatment start), and 6&#x000a0;months after treatment completion (post-treatment).

Some QoL scores were missing if an outcome was not recorded during a visit, the patient died before a follow-up visit, or the patient did not return for a follow-up visit within 8 months (16 months for people with MDR) of the last visit. Planned visits of participants who did not yet reach the time of the scheduled follow-up were excluded. Missing scores of other visits were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations based on QoL scores and baseline patient characteristics. We generated 20 datasets during imputation. In addition, we calculated standardised QoL scores (<italic>z</italic>-scores) in each dataset to make our estimation results comparable for continuous scores measured on different scales.

We observed that the mental, physical, and respiratory health-related QoL were substantially impaired at the time of treatment initiation. All QoL outcomes improved during TB treatment and most continued to improve post-treatment. We identified vulnerable groups at higher risk of impaired QoL, especially women and people with a history of TB.</p><p id="Par50">We found that multiple dimensions of mental and physical QoL outcomes were impaired in people with TB at treatment initiation and improved during treatment. Symptoms of depression and mental health scores remained low and other measures continued to improve post-treatment. The results were consistent when analysing fixed cut-offs and continuous data and were comparable across countries. The persistence of physical impairment at the end of treatment may reflect the fact that lung function impairments take longer to resolve, often up to 12&#x02013;18&#x000a0;months after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], even though respiratory symptoms have been shown to resolve more quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with a study in South Africa where QoL was reported as poor at treatment initiations, with improvements during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A study conducted in Malaysia showed that physical and mental QoL scores of people with TB remained worse than within the general population throughout treatment, with a persisting higher risk of depression at the end of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A cross-sectional study in South Africa reported that the mean summary scores obtained for mental and physical health were lower than the population norm in post-TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Almost half of our study participants had depressive symptoms at treatment initiation when using a region-specific PHQ-9 cut-off&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and less than 25% when using the universal PHQ-9 cut-off&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A meta-analysis estimated that 45% of people with TB experience symptoms of depression at the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We also showed that almost 75% of our participants had an impaired mental health-related QoL at baseline, indicating the importance of integrating mental health care for people with TB. Large reductions in impaired QoL during TB treatment were observed for mental health-related QoL and depressive symptoms, which is consistent with a smaller observational study in Peru [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We did not observe any further improvement in participants&#x02019; depressive symptoms, although the symptom scores were already at a low level by the end of treatment. Only a few participants reported receiving any mental health treatment during the study period. A persistently low mental health-related QoL at the end of TB treatment was more frequently reported among women and people with a history of TB.</p><p id="Par52">We found that certain individual factors had an impact on QoL in people with TB, including age, gender, prior history of TB, living with HIV, and MDR TB. Overall, persistently low QoL (lowest quintiles of the scores at the end of treatment) was associated with female gender and a history of TB. The association between previous TB episodes and worse QoL scores is consistent with a study in the USA that reported a cumulative negative impact of repeated previous TB episodes on physical and mental well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Our finding that women with TB had worse mental and physical QoL may reflect gender-related health inequities, which may be particularly severe in a context of highly stigmatised diseases such as TB and HIV, and for which underlying socioeconomic challenges prevail. The association between gender and TB-associated QoL impairment is consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], although most were limited by their sample size or had shorter follow-up periods. Younger age has previously been associated with better outcomes on certain QoL scores (WHOQOL-BREF or SF-36) during treatment in single-country studies in Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In our study, living with HIV was associated with lower mental and physical QoL at baseline, but not at the end of treatment and post-treatment. We also found that QoL was lower in people with MDR TB than in those with drug-susceptible TB. However, these differences were inconsistent over time. Some associations observed at baseline disappeared or even reversed during follow-up, potentially suggesting the balancing benefits of individual resilience and rehabilitation among people with MDR TB. In contrast, a study from urban South Africa showed that health-related QoL was lower in MDR compared with non-MDR TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Our study has limitations. First, the participating sites in IeDEA Southern Africa may not be fully representative of tuberculosis and HIV care at the national or regional level. However, the diversity between sites ensures that our data broadly reflect prevailing trends in high TB and HIV burden settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Second, we acknowledge that loss to follow-up is an inherent challenge in longitudinal studies, particularly in African settings where migration is high. Although some residual bias may remain, our sensitivity analysis indicated that only an implausibly severe worsening of QoL scores among those lost to follow-up would have offset the observed improvements. Third, QoL instruments such as PHQ-9 and SF-12 rely on self-reported symptoms, which may be associated with inherent biases, such as desirability biases. However, these are widely validated and used tools, which ensure comparability between studies and settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">Our study highlights the impact of TB on mental and physical health-related QoL during and beyond treatment in the Southern African region with a high TB and HIV burden. We reported impairments at both mental and physical health levels at TB treatment start, with marked improvements during treatment and further improvements in some physical outcomes post-treatment. Traditionally, TB programs have focussed on successfully treating the infectious disease and its symptoms to prevent mortality and avoid morbidity. Our study adds to the knowledge of the global burden of end- and post-treatment TB and highlights the importance of QoL monitoring and care, especially for vulnerable populations, in addition to appropriate infectious disease management focussed on treatment completion. As such, our study advocates for integrated mental and physical health care and rehabilitation along with routine clinical TB care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] using a patient-centred approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
